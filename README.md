# Ward

*Run tests the easy way!*

**Ward** allows to automagically start tests when files are modified. Unlike the *testthat::auto_test()*, **Ward** runs in the terminal, so you're R console is free to use. Furthermore, **Ward** finds the corresponding test of a modified file by itself and executes it.
